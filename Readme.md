# Waiting for Devil Survivor
This is an **unofficial** recreation of the 2011 Atlus video game [Devil Survivor Overclocked](https://atlus.com/atlus-titles/overclocked/).

The game's code has been written from scratch without reference to the original source code or decompilation. Most graphic, sound, text, etc. assets are either sourced directly from the original work or derivative of it, so no ownership is claimed. Please do not think otherwise. Neither this project or any of its assets will ever be sold by me or anybody who has worked on it. Do not purchase any digital or physical goods related to *Waiting for Devil Survivor*.

The original game utilizes an in-house engine and was built for the Nintendo 3DS. The goal with this recreation is to preserve the original experience in an enhanced form using [Godot 4](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

The wait for Devil Survivor will probably never end, so I hope that I can at least make that eternity a bit more bearable this way.

All said, please enjoy the game, and modify it to your heart's content.
